Instructions for adding your custom world map:

1. Open your MapChart_Map.svg file in a text editor
2. Copy the ENTIRE content
3. Replace the content of: C:\Projects\grand-strategy-game\public\assets\earth-map.svg

The SVG should have:
- Each country/region as a <path> element
- Each path should have an 'id' attribute (like 'US', 'RU', 'CN')
- The paths will be used for game territory logic

The SVGGlobeRenderer.js will:
- Parse each path as a separate game region
- Allow ownership changes (player, ally, hostile, neutral)
- Color territories based on who owns them
- Support click detection for territory selection
